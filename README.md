# personal-site
 A personal site and the first website I made from scratch. The site will mostly act as a portfolio for some projects (both technical work and passion projects) I have worked on as an undergraduate and graduate student in mechanical engineering. In the future, I hope to add more functionality and optimize it. 
 
 Find the site at https://bettinark.github.io/
