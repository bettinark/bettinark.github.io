        <p> During my time at MIT and Georgia Tech, I worked on several projects and initiatives.
          These projects have spanned from robotics and hack-a-thons to community initiatives and equity-focused work.
          Although the projects discussed on this page are diverse in nature, I tend to have interests in
          engineering, humanitarian and policy-focused work, so each project will fall under one
          or more of those categories.
          Quite a few of these projects were recently started and are still ongoing. See more below!

                          Over the first two and a half years of graduate school, I created an electrothermal
                          probe capable of withstanding high temperatures (>600°C). Along with going through
                          the various iterations of this probe’s design, I worked on the sensitivity, data
                          and error analysis needed for gathering thermophysical properties from the
                          probe. The goal of the probe was
                          to measure high-temperature fluidized heat transfer media
                          (HTM) - particularly molten chloride salts - for the U.S. Department of
                          Energy’s Generation 3 Concentrating Solar Power (Gen3CSP) Initiative.

                            A concentrating solar power plant (click image to enlarge) is composed of a
                             field of "mirrors" known as heliostats that direct
                            sunlight towards a receiver. Heat transfer media (HTM) flows past that receiver and
                            stores thermal energy from sunlight. This HTM is then transported to a heat exchanger
                            and used to generate electricity via a power cycle.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 2018, the Department of Energy began the <a href=
                            "https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/generation-3-concentrating-solar-power-systems-gen3-csp"
                            target="_blank">Generation 3 Concentrating Solar Power
                            (Gen3CSP) Initiative</a>, which sought to create a concentrating
                            solar power plant so efficient that it could compete with the
                            cost of electricity generated by non-renewable resources. In order to ensure the
                            desired efficiency is reached, this plant will operate at higher temperatures
                            than its predecessors. Due to this new higher temperature range, there is a lack
                            of thermophysical information about the plant’s potential HTM options. The probe
                            I designed was made for characterizing high-temperature heat transfer media for
                            use in energy systems like the Gen3CSP plant.

                            Using the 3𝜔 technique, this probe finds the thermal conductivity and heat capacity
                            of the heat transfer medium of interest. The 3𝜔 technique uses a thin (nanoscale) metallic
                            sensor, or heater line, to propagate heat at a given frequency into the specimen.
                            The local change in temperature of the specimen is then measured by the same sensor
                            and recorded. This data is plotted for various frequencies and fit to a model – in my
                            case, the multi-layered radial heat transfer model. That fitting gives the thermal
                            conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the HTM.

                              As we rely more on screen-based technologies like cellphones
                              and tablets, for everything from work to entertainment and
                              spend more and more time on these devices, they have become
                              integral parts of the modern American’s life. Along with electronic
                              screens, various flat surfaces have risen in popularity to communicate
                              information on devices such as electronic stoves, scanners and washing
                              machines. Such surfaces contain vital visual information that are often
                              indistinguishable for people who are visually impaired and blind.

                              We used a vibration-based motor-screw matrix for actuating pins in
                              the display due to its manufacturability and the fact that its accompanying
                              tactile interface tested the best with clients. The vibration-induced
                              pin matrix was inspired by <a href="https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/files/thesis/2013/bjpeters-ms.pdf

                                The final design is composed of a smooth plastic enclosure, a large power
                                button at the front of the device, a power jack, USB port and over 700 pins.
                                In the final version of the device, the plastic enclosure will be made using
                                injection molding. The side of the device has a USB port and power jack that
                                can easily be accessed by the user. The top of the device has the 3-mm round
                                tops of the pins exposed. The section with the pins is 5” x 5” and the device
                                is 10.3”x10.3” with a total height of 4.40”.

                                <br>
                                The device is designed to raise the pins by about 3-4mm - creating distinct
                                “raised” and “lowered” binary positions. In the case of impact, pins are
                                protected using the raised top of the device. The cover is made to completely
                                enclose the internal actuation mechanisms of the device from every angle.

                                  Future iterations of the device may incorporate items such as a flexible elastic
                                  sheet to cover the pins to make for more contiguous contours or a more advanced
                                  gear train that takes advantage of the need for opposite facing preload axles to
                                  be synchronized. Such a gear train may require only one stepper motor to control
                                  all preload axles. Initial prototypes are expected to be more costly to manufacture
                                  and include more parts than our final mass-manufacturable design which will require
                                  injection molding and optimized tooling for placing parts such as the set screws and
                                  pins during device assembly.

                                  Bioplastics have become commonly used in many everyday plastic goods.
                                  For my first graduate design course, my team and I sought
                                  to fulfill this need by designing a functional, effective,
                                  and inexpensive composting solution for food courts,
                                  restaurants, and eateries to implement in their facilities.

                                          In the words of former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon,
                                          “We are the first generation to be able to end poverty,
                                          and the last generation that can take steps to avoid the
                                          worst impacts of climate change." As we create new sustainable
                                          energy technologies, a need still exists for us to better engineer
                                          them to serve everyone; therefore, I am pursing research at the
                                          intersection of energy, design and equity.

                                          Overall, I seek to use my knowledge of emerging sustainable energy
                                          technologies to create frameworks for equitable energy system design.
                                          Although many solutions to energy inequity are typically viewed at the
                                          policy level, I am seeking to understand and address these inequities
                                          starting further upstream in the process – from the viewpoint of mechanical
                                          design. My overarching research question is: “How can design methodologies
                                          be used to guide and assess the equitable application of energy technologies?”

                                          I sought to create a place within the Georgia Tech College of Engineering (CoE)
                                          that could house equity-focused research like mine. So,
                                          I proposed the creation of an Institute for Engineering Equity under the CoE through
                                          its Student Innovation Competition - Promoting Equity and Access (SICPEA) in
                                          February 2021.

                                          <br>
                                          There are three main issues that the application sought to address:
                                          <ol>
                                            <li>The underrepresentation of racial and gender minority graduate students in the College of
                                              Engineering</li>
                                              <br>
                                              <li>The lack of opportunity, resources and encouragement for underrepresented graduate
                                                students who seek to do research that impacts their communities</li>
                                                <br>
                                                <li>The lack of an institutionalized way to work on research projects at the intersection of
                                                  engineering and equity</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                <br>
                                                The IEE would address these issues by creating a fellowship and
                                                 providing students with an opportunity to pursue graduate engineering
                                                research to aid disenfranchised populations.

                                                    In a quest to quantify power within the United States, I took a preliminary view into Political Action Committee (PAC) donors, their estimated wealth, the most popular PACs and the political parties they are donating to. Due to the limited time for this project, only data sets from 2018 were used. Donors who gave to the top 20 PACs by amount in 2018 and paid at least $200 were observed as well as 2018 IRS data and 2018 PAC contributions to political parties view the OpenSecrets website. More data analysis is needed to form conclusions on the correlation between wealth and PAC contributions, but from preliminary analysis, the higher one is in income, the more likely it is that they will donate to a PAC - with majority of donations coming from the top ̃30% of incomes and exponentially decreasing with lowering income range. This preliminary view provides a framework by which I can begin the larger project of quantifying political power in the United States by observing more factors - financial or otherwise - contributing to an individual’s or institution’s power in our society.

                                                    Over the course of the weekend, we drafted policy memos as

                                                  Water Filtration Using Plant Xylem</a>, the xylem from
                                                  the sapwood of coniferous trees was found to be an effective and
                                                  low-cost water filter. For my undergraduate senior thesis, I sought to create a convenient
                                                  and effective method for carrying out quality control tests during the manufacturing process of these xylem filters.

                                                  Laboratory allowed me to utilize my backgrounds in both biology and
                                                  mechanical engineering. I created a protocol for failure testing of the xylem filter
                                                  and instrumentation to affordably and efficiently test these filters by hand
                                                  using particulates seeded in fluid.

                                                    The goal of my thesis was to create the criteria, design the system, and identify
                                                    the materials and hardware that could be used to create a simple, consistent
                                                    and easy-to-use testing setup. To reduce costs, the testing was also to be done
                                                    by hand. The ultimate goal was to create a device that would
                                                    identify the permeability and rejection of the filter.

                                                    For destructive testing, I used a syringe design in which the user could use dye,
                                                    seeded particles like tumeric and provide pressure through the filter by pressing
                                                    the water through the syringe and collecting filtrate.

                                                    For non-destructive testing, I used an asthma inhaler as a model for the
                                                    design because an inhaler allows the user to deliver a pre-determined amount
                                                    of air containing particles that will function as ther "contaminants". The
                                                    inhaler-based design contains both the inhaler and a slotted base to allow
                                                    manufacturers easy access to the filter.

                                                  In my Design and Manufacturing II class,
                                                  we formed teams of about 5-6 students and created a yo-yo of
                                                  our own design for the final project. This class focused
                                                  on techniques of manufacturing from SLA for prototyping to
                                                  machining and injection molding techniques for mass-production.

                                                  My team designed a yo-yo based on yodeling. This yo-yo consisted
                                                  of a glow-in-the-dark moon face, a dark blue "night-time" body, and a bright
                                                  red "yodeler" as seen in the images above. Our yo-yo stood atop a green mountain
                                                  base that we thermoformed.

                                                  It was made to inch up a wooden rod for my Design & Manufacturing I (2.007) class.

                                                  The "Inchworm" had two clamps made from ABS that was softened and molded around a cylindrical rod.
                                                  These clamps were then lined with rubber to enhance the robot's grip.
                                                  The robot was designed to inch up the pole by alternating  clamps, using a lead screw and slots.

                                                  The final robot ended up being heavier with the addition of guides and that
                                                  moved the robot's center of gravity further from the pole, making it more
                                                  difficult to sustain its grip as it moved up the pole. In the end, the robot was
                                                  able to grip the pole but the pivoting during climbing made it difficult to
                                                  continuously climb up the pole.
                                                  At the end of the class, it was dubbed one of the most complex robot designs of the class.

                                                  My collegiate research journey started in Dr. Ed
                                                  Boyden’s Synthetic Neurobiology Group in the McGovern
                                                  Institute for Brain Research and the MIT Media Lab. For
                                                  my research project, I designed and built an updated mouse
                                                  virtual reality system for recording in vivo neural-activity
                                                  in mice. I also analyzed the performance of mice in a virtual
                                                  reality system that was used to record neural activity in
                                                  vivo to retrieve new data to be included in grants and
                                                  publications.

                                                  in this lab that I discovered my love for mechanical design.
                                                  I learned the avenue by which one ventures from research to
                                                  fabrication.

                                                  These systems allow neuroscientists to perform in vivo neural recordings.
                                                  Such recordings were used to monitor the physiological progression of neurodegenerative
                                                  diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Mice were trained and observed on
                                                  a virtual reality system.

                                                  This VR system for mice consists of a spherical treadmill,
                                                  head-plate support system and a display system. The spherical
                                                  treadmill design was initially provided by researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's
                                                  Janelia Research Center. The spherical treadmill consisted of a light,
                                                  foam ball that floats on 10 Ping-pong ball air cannons supported by an
                                                  acrylic base. I built all parts of the system from scratch aside from the foam ball
                                                  and projection system.

                                                  I also worked to assess the ability for mice to carry out complex
                                                  tasks in virtual reality. I used a lickometer to characterize the ability for mice to learn more
                                                  complex tasks such as licking at particular points in a virtual maze.

                                                  Random Acts of Kindness (RAK) Week at MIT is a week
                                                  in March dedicated to building connections among
                                                  members of the MIT community. During the spring
                                                  semester of my freshman year, my friend Cory and
                                                  I were talking about the need to bring some more
                                                  forms of upliftment to MIT. In the beginning of our
                                                  sophomore year, the Mind+Hand+Heart Initiative created
                                                  the Innovation Fund, which funded community and mental
                                                  health related ideas. Through this fund as well as
                                                  funding from the MIT Baker Foundation, the Office of
                                                  Minority Education, the Office of Graduate Education
                                                  and the MIT Large Event Fund, we were able to make our
                                                  idea a reality.

                                                  conversations around campus. Now, RAK Week has become an
                                                  annual event at MIT.

                                                  At the beginning of my junior year, I was speaking to some of my
                                                   friends about experiences with not being able to afford food in college.
                                                   After these discussions, I decided that it was an issue that needed to
                                                   be addressed. I reached out to some friends who were working with the
                                                   CASE (Class Awareness, Support and Equality) student group and found
                                                   that they had sent out a survey that inquired about financial issues to
                                                   the undergraduate population. They found that over <a href = "https://thetech.com/2017/10/12/case-survey-results"

                                                    have experienced food insecurity</a> while at MIT. After seeing how wide-spread
                                                    this problem was, I decided to join CASE and became the head of the group's
                                                    food insecurity team in my senior year.

                                                    Through funding from the MIT Women's League, we began the first program
                                                    to aid undergraduate students who experience food insecurity in January
                                                    2018. Students were able to sign up to receive Free Food Care Packages.
                                                    The package program contained fresh groceries for students to eat during
                                                    the Intermediate Activities Period. This program continued in summer 2018
                                                    and was expanded to include graduate students, as well. Along with the care
                                                    package, we included the tips and recipes below - which corresponded to some
                                                    of the items in the packages.

                                                    Along with the fresh food package program, we started in-dorm food pantries,

                                                    In addition to creating in-dorm food pantries in all of the undergraduate dorms
                                                    without dining halls, we started a program for collecting and recycling unopened,
                                                    non-perishable foods from students at the end of the year to restock the food pantries.

                                                  The first "hack-a-thon" I attended was MakeMIT.
                                                  This make-a-thon focused on hardware projects.
                                                  My team worked to create a motion sensor device
                                                  that allows you to take pictures with friends in
                                                  the Infinite Corridor. After these pictures were
                                                  taken, the computer would loop through them -
                                                  providing viewers with "snapshots" from other people's
                                                  days. We used a raspberry pi to encode the motion sensor
                                                  and camera. It didn’t end up completely working,
                                                  but it was still fun :)

                                                  2017 was the first time the Breaking the Mold Hackathon
                                                  was held. This hackathon focused on unconscious bias
                                                  in the workplace. My team focused on the topic of accent
                                                  bias during the hiring process. We sought to develop
                                                  a program that would identify the accent biases of
                                                  hiring managers and use these bias test results to
                                                  normalize the results from their employee recruitment.
                                                  My friend Samantha and I were the only undergraduates
                                                  on our team, but we were the lead programmers. Our
                                                  idea was based off of <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html"

                                                  tests. We used the voices of our teammates with
                                                  accents and those without (according to the Northeastern
                                                  region of the U.S.) to create the audio clips.

                                                  During the summer of 2016, I spent some time in China as a participant of the
                                                  inaugural US Huawei Seeds for the Future program. I was given the opportunity
                                                  to practice my Mandarin at <a href="http://english.blcu.edu.cn/"

                                                  and immerse myself in Chinese culture with 19 other American students. After
                                                  Beijing, we headed to Shenzhen and stayed at the Huawei campus. While there, we
                                                  learned about Huawei’s telecommunication technology and network as well as future
                                                  innovations and work toward the Internet of Things and 5G. Finally, we received technical training at Huawei facilities for operating machines responsible for 2G, 3G, LTE and landline connections.

                                                    I have taken a couple of jobs as a videographer.
                                                    I also enjoy shooting and editing videos in my spare time.
                                                    The first experience I had with videography was during my freshman year.
                                                    A couple of friends and I wanted to create a video for students to watch
                                                    during freshman orientation. We wanted to aid in breaking down the barrier
                                                    between students and their professors, so we made a video about professor

                                                    (UAAP) Office. We played the role of the directors and interviewers of the video
                                                    and the MIT Audio-Visual Services handled the video shooting and editing. You can
