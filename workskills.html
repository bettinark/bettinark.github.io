                    I took on a position as a teaching
                    assistant for freshman physics mechanics (8.01) my sophomore year.
                    I was a physics TA from that time on.
                    I was an 8.01 TA for three years and an 8.02 (electricity and magnetism) TA for a year.

                    As a student who had struggled with physics in high school,
                    I am able to empathize with students who may have difficulty
                    initially understanding the subject matter.
                    I led weekly office hours, review sessions and recitations.
                    My recitation section from my junior year made the card that I am holding in the image and
                    I still have it to this day!

                    As an undergraduate, I had two industry experiences. One experience was
                    at a small neurotechnology startup (NeuroVigil) where I worked as a
                    product design intern on a mass-consumer product and designed prototypes
                    for the enclosures of these products, smaller-market devices and an encoding rig
                    for manufacturing.
                    The other experience was at a large company (IBM) where I worked as a
                    project management intern. Since I cannot provide much information on my
                    work at the startup due to confidentiality, I will give a brief overview of my experience at IBM.
                    <br>

                    <h2>IBM</h2>

                    At IBM, I was working within their Real Estate Strategy and Operations (RESO)
                    team as a project management intern. I was tasked with aiding to facilitate the team‚Äôs transition
                    from an old style of working to a new Agile style of working.  Along with aiding this transition,
                    I also co-chaired a client experience surveillance project and created GUIs for more intuitive use
                    of an Excel database for the project managers. At the end of the summer, I created an interactive
                    poster presentation that is portrayed in the images below. The poster demonstrated my summer journey
                    and was modeled off of the game Candy Land. Each colored "tile" was associated with a card that would
                    give a player the next steps to take. All of those cards were based off of experiences I had that
                    summer. The goal of the game was to get to the "AGILE" mark and the winner was allowed to sign
                    the poster as a reward.

                    Since my first year at MIT, I sought to act as a mentor for
                    students who were in situations I once found myself in.
                    I recognize that many of the oportunities and successes
                    I have had in life have been through the mentors, teachers
                    and motivators I've encountered. These people have positively
                    impacted my life; therefore, I strive to positively impact the lives of others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I first began participating in community outreach my freshman year
                    as a project mentor for the MIT Leadership Training Institute.
                    This student group guided local high school students as they pursued
                    their own community service projects. I also worked with high school
                    students in the summer. During the summers before my sophomore and junior years,
                    I was a residential advisor for various MIT outreach programs for high school students
                    such as MathRoots, the Engineering Experience (E2) and the
                    MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community (MOSTEC).
                    I would act as a confidant and mentor for the students in my clusters during
                    these summer programs.
                    The image is of me and my cluster on the first day of the
                    Engineering Experience (E2) program run by the MIT Office of Engineering Outreach Programs (OEOP).
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I was a participant in one of the OEOP programs when I was a rising senior in high school
                      and it changed the trajectory of my life, so mentoring feels like paying it forward :)
